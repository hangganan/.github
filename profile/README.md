# Project Hangganan

**Project Hangganan** aims to build comprehensive spatial data on the administrative and legislative subdivisions of the Philippines encompassing regions, provinces, cities, municipalities, districts, barangays, and more.

We use [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org) (OSM) as our main spatial database, and [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) as our main attribute database. And through the principles of [5-star Open Data](https://5stardata.info/en/), we will link corresponding OSM and Wikidata entities with each other via OSM tags like [`wikidata=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:wikidata) and Wikidata properties like [P402](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P402), as well as using the [Philippine Standard Geographic Code](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc) of the Philippine Statistics Authority and [Wikidata QIDs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Glossary#QID) to uniquely identify administrative entities.

Inspired by similar projects like [GADM](https://gadm.org/), [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), and [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/), we aim to make our data widely accessible and become a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and policymakers interested in the Philippines’ administrative geography.

## What’s in a Name?

“Hangganan” is a Tagalog word meaning “boundary” or “border”, making it a fitting name for a project based on how Filipinos mark the limits of Philippine governance at various levels. More than just lines on a map, these boundaries shape identities, policy implementation, public services, and local governance.
